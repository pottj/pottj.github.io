I am a genetic epidemiologist working on genome-wide association studies and causal inference models (aka Mendelian Randomization). Research Objective The goal of my research is to contribute to personalized medicine via genetic epidemiology. This includes analyzing the molecular sex differences in multiple OMICS levels as well as the different risk profile for various diseases, which are also age-dependent. For this, I use genetic summary statistics from large-scale studies, genetic consortia and electronic health data in causal models of Mendelian Randomization.

Examples include coronary artery disease , chronic kidney disease , and Alzheimer's disease . Also immune response and inflammatory pathways differ between men and women. Within this project, I plan to analyse (hormonal) sex differences in multiple OMICS levels as well as complex diseases. Hormone levels highly depend on phase of life, with changes during puberty in both sexes, and menopause and the menstrual cycle in women. Hence, I will also include data from longitudinal studies and expand cross-sectional studies with data from electronic health records.
